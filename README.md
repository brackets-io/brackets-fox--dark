### How to Activate

Activate the UI theme and color scheme by modifying your user preferences file, which you can find using the menu item `Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Settings - User` (<kbd>âŒ˜</kbd><kbd>,</kbd> on Mac).

You can choose whichever flavor you like, but don't forget to change *both* color scheme and UI theme so they match.

***Note: Don't forget to restart Sublime Text after activating the theme.***

#### Settings for Fox

```json
{
  "theme": "Fox.sublime-theme",
  "color_scheme": "Packages/Theme - Fox/fox.dark.tmTheme"
}
```
